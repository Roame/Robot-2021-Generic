// A log file is a sequence of size prefixed flatbuffers.
// The first flatbuffer will be the LogFileHeader, followed by an arbitrary
// number of MessageHeaders.
//
// The log file starts at the time demarcated in the header on the monotonic
// clock.  There will be any number of messages per channel logged before the
// start time.  These messages are logged so that fetchers can retrieve the
// state of the system at the start of the logfile for things like capturing
// parameters.  In replay, they should be made available to fetchers, but not
// trigger watchers.
